# Leveraging AI in Combating Fake News through Stance Detection
## Introduction
Problem Identification: The rapid spread of misinformation, often referred to as 'fake news', poses a significant challenge in the digital age. The reliance on human fact-checkers is limited due to the vast amount of data on the internet.
Context and Background: The proliferation of digital media has led to the rapid spread of news, but also misinformation, which can have serious societal, political, and economic repercussions.
Significance: Addressing misinformation is vital for maintaining the integrity of information in the digital space.

## Problem Statement
Purpose: Developing an automated Stance Detection project to improve the efficiency and scalability of misinformation detection.
Hypothesis: Employing deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM networks and CNN, can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of Stance Detection in identifying potential fake news articles.
Scope: Focused on deep learning techniques application in the context of news articles.

## Data Used
Source: The primary dataset is derived from the Emergent Dataset, structured for addressing fake news detection, available on the FNC-1 GitHub repository.
Dataset Details: Comprises pairs of headlines and body texts which can originate from the same or different articles, used for classifying the stance of the body text in relation to the headline.
## Analysis
Data Preprocessing and Transformation: Includes loading data, merging stances with bodies, and subsetting train data.

Feature Engineering and Selection: Generating new features to capture numerical aspects in the text data and analyzing frequency distribution for different categories.

Explanatory Data Analysis: Distribution of stance labels, numerical features, pairwise scatter plots, and correlation matrix.
## Implementing Embedding Layer
Methods: Exploration of three pre-trained word embedding models: GloVe, FastText, and Word2Vec.
Evaluation: Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of these models to ascertain the quality of embeddings.
## Conclusion
Key Findings: Comparative analysis of embedding methods, highlighting trade-offs between accuracy, running time, and model complexity.
Preferred Model: GloVe, for its ability to capture deep semantic relationships in words, is chosen for the forthcoming stages of the project.
## Modeling
Models Explored: GloVe Embedding with LSTM, and CNN for text classification.
Model Evaluation: Comparative analysis of the two models to assess effectiveness in textual data handling for stance detection.

## Business Implementation
Impact: Revolutionizing how news agencies, businesses, and the public interact with online information.
Advantages: Operational efficiency, enhanced accuracy, scalability, and fostering trust in digital media.
Future Roadmap: Continuous improvement of models and ethical considerations in algorithmic decision-making.
